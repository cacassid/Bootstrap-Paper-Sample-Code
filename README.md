# Code for the manuscript "Accounting for outcome misclassification in complex sample designs: estimation of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in central North Carolina"


This SAS file provides code to calculate corrected seroprevalence estimates with corresponding 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.


## Construction of example dataset
The randomly generated data used in this code is designed to illustrate the necessary data structure and variables required to use this method. Note that we demonstrate this method using a hypothetical three-stage sample, but this method can be applied to a different number of stages.

Variable descriptions:
- **participant_id** ID number for each individual study participant
- **sex** sex of participant (In example, =1 if male, =0 if female)
- **age** age in years of participant
- **age_cat** age category of participant (In example, =1 if age between 18 and 49 , =2 if age 50+)
- **serostatus** indicates binary serological test result of participant (In example, =1 if positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, =0 otherwise)
- **STRATUM** sample stratum number (In example, =1,2, or 3)
- **CLUSTER_NUM** sample cluster number (In example, =1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, or 9)
- **PSU_WT** weight component for each PSU (reciprocal of probability that a PSU was selected at the first stage of sampling. Note: In C4/example, census blocks served as PSUs)
- **HH_WT** weight component for each SSU (reciprocal of probability that a SSU was selected at the second stage of sampling, conditional on the selection of its corresponding PSU at the first stage of sampling. Note: In C4/example, households served as SSUs)
- **PER_WT** weight component for each individual (reciprocal of probability that a person was selected at the third stage of sampling, conditional on the selection of their corresponding PSU and SSU at the first and second stages of sampling.
- **BASEWT** base weight (reciprocal of participantâ€™s overall probability of selection Note: BASEWT=PSU_WT * HH_WT * PER_WT)


## Weight calibration
We use PROC WTADJUST procedure from SUDAAN v 11.0.3 for calibration of sample weights.
